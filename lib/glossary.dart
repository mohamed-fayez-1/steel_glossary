The "leakage" might occur because a polluting company decides to move its activities to somewhere with weaker environmental regulation. Equally, it could happen because the cost of environmental compliance results in a polluter in one country reducing or closing activity, but another company or companies in a less regulated part of the world starting, or increasing activity to fill the supply gap. In the case of steelmaking in advanced industrial economies like Europe, the likelihood of carbon leakage by companies moving elsewhere is further enhanced by the inherently more favorable economics of basic steel production in certain other countries anyway, irrespective of environmental considerations.'

A key characteristic is that when heated in the absence of air, this coal, unlike steaming coal, will form the hard, sponge-like material known as coke. Also, as steelmakers are looking to produce high iron purity, the coal needs to have high-carbon, but relatively low ash, sulfur and phosphorus content. Also, coke should not physically break down as it travels down through the blast furnace (along with iron ore and limestone), so helping to retain permeability in the ironmaking burden. The terms "hard", and "semi-soft" actually refer to the coal\'s readiness to form coke ("hard" is best), and not its physical hardness. However, "hard" coal does happen to produce physically hard coke.

For example, a plant that emits 1m tonnes of greenhouse gases in a year will have to hand over 1m carbon credits at the end of that year. In the European emissions trading system, the only fully functioning international scheme, most plants currently receive their carbon credits for free from national governments. They therefore only have to buy additional credits when their emissions exceed expectations. However, this should change slowly from 2013 when phase III (2013-2020) of the program begins. The number of free allocations is expected to decrease, forcing plants to buy an ever greater number of credits on the market or cut their emissions.'

This is a very time-consuming and expensive exercise which steelmakers go to great lengths to avoid. Hot idling is a procedure for temporarily maintaining a furnace on standby without producing any iron. The main chamber is kept fully charged with coke (but not with limestone and iron ore, the other two bulk ingredients for ironmaking), and the amount of air entering the furnace is significantly reduced, slowing combustion while maintaining the refractory lining at temperatures that prevent deterioration. The term "banking" is also used for this procedure. Blast furnaces are not usually hot idled for more than a few weeks unless all the iron is completely drained from the furnace, and they can be returned to full ironmaking capacity within a matter of days. Normally, blast furnaces can be operated continuously for up to about 15 years between major maintenance work, a period known as a "campaign".'

    'term': 'Hydrogen Embrittlement',
    'definition':
        'A process resulting in a decrease of the toughness or ductility of a metal due to the presence of atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen embrittlement has been recognized classically as being of two types. The first, known as internal hydrogen embrittlement, occurs when the hydrogen enters molten metal which becomes supersaturated with hydrogen immediately after solidification. The second type, environmental hydrogen embrittlement, results from hydrogen being absorbed by solid metals. This can occur during elevated-temperature thermal treatments and in service during electroplating, contact with maintenance chemicals, corrosion reactions, cathodic protection and operating in high pressure hydrogen. In the absence of residual stress or external loading, environmental hydrogen embrittlement is manifested in various forms such as blistering, internal cracking, hydride formation and reduced ductility. With a tensile stress or stress-intensity factor exceeding a specific threshold, the atomic hydrogen interacts with the metal to induce subcritical crack growth leading to fracture. In the absence of a corrosion reaction (polarized cathodically), the usual term used is hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC) or hydrogen stress cracking (HSC). In the presence of active corrosion, usually as pits or crevices (polarized anodically), the cracking is generally called stress-corrosion cracking (SCC), but should more properly be called hydrogen-assisted stress-corrosion cracking (HSCC). Thus, HSC and electrochemically anodic SCC can operate separately or in combination (HSCC). In some metals, such as high-strength steels, the mechanism is believed to be all HSC. The participating mechanism of HSC is not always recognized and may be evaluated under the generic heading of SCC.'

This creates magnetic fields which cause electrical currents (eddy currents) in the iron/steel scrap charge, heating and melting it. Once the charge is in a molten state the eddy currents generate a stirring action. The capital cost of the induction furnace is lower than the EAF, it uses less power per tonne melted and there are no recurring electrode costs. However, there is a size constraint. They typically range from 5-100t capacity for steel melting, but most operating units are towards the lower end. This makes them smaller than most EAFs. Induction furnaces are mainly used by foundries, except in India where they also account for several million tonnes/year of mainstream steel production. Although cleaner than the cupola furnace, which is also popular with foundries, the induction furnace does require a reliable electricity supply.'

Inmetco, unlike other direct reduction products, is intended to be hot charged into an EAF, with attendant energy savings. The process includes three steps. First, iron oxide fines, pulverized coal and a binder are formed into pellets. Second, the pellets, two to three layers deep, are heated in a gas-fired rotary hearth furnace for 15-20 minutes to produce sponge iron. Subsequently, the iron must be desulfurized. The coal in the pellets provides much of the energy required in the second phase.'

Drill pipe connects the drill bit with the drilling motor during well drilling and is usually about 2-6.5 in. (50-165mm) outside dia. Drilling mud is pumped down the pipe to cool the drill bit, while drilled material travels up it to the surface. The very demanding operational conditions mean drill pipe is always seamless. Casing acts as the liner and structural wall of oil/gas wells, preventing contamination of the well and of the surrounding water table, and can be up to 26 in. dia. Casing accounts for about three quarters of all OCTG shipments. The third type is oil well tubing. This is used to bring oil/gas out of a well and is usually around 2-4.5 in. dia.'

The desirable qualities in a PCI coal relate both to its thermal performance in the furnace, and to its physical characteristics (which vary depending on the individual coal preparation, handling and injection techniques used). Coal with a low phosphorus, low sulfur and low ash content is sought, and other key qualities are a good calorific value and good combustibility. As already indicated, coking qualities are not required. High volatility coals are desirable for their ready combustibility, but high volatility is not synonymous with a high calorific value (which increases the coke replacement rate that can be achieved), so there has to be something of a compromise here. The behavior of ash, char and any remnant coal particles in the furnace is also an important consideration when selecting coals for PCI.'

When steel is rolled back-and-forth through the same mill, this is a reversing mill. When it moves directly in a continuous process to other mill stands, this is a tandem or continuous mill. These can achieve far higher throughputs than a reversing mill. Tandem mills are associated with flat products and typically have four or six stands.

Key operations can include deoxidation, desulfurization and dephosphorization. Not only does the use of secondary metallurgy enable a larger range of steel grades to be cast, but fine tuning steel composition in a separate furnace greatly improves the productivity of the main steelmaking unit.

Stainless steel sheet or strip passes between a matching pair of small work rolls with extremely smooth surfaces, heavily reinforced by clusters of backup rolls. The rolls reduce the steel to the desired thickness. A typical Sendzimir rolling stand is immediately recognizable by its large number of small diameter backup rolls (typically about 20) clustered around two small-diameter work rolls. This is in contrast to the large diameter work rolls and two or four large backup rolls on most rolling mills. The large number of backup rolls on the Sendzimir allows very high reduction forces to be exerted on the passing sheet, and gauges down to 0.025mm are not unusual for stainless steel – although several passes through the mill may be required to achieve this. After each cold reduction, stainless coil must be annealed before it can be further processed. The original design was developed by the Polish engineer Tadeusz Sendzimir, but this type of mill is also referred to as a Z-mill or cluster mill, and apart from rolling stainless, is used for silicon and certain carbon steels, as well as some nonferrous metals.'

Austenitics are non-magnetic, easily formed, but harden rapidly during processing (typically used in the process industries, heat exchangers, cutlery). Ferritics are less corrosion-resistant, easily formed and magnetic (catering, architectural, materials handling).

Mills were faced with sharply escalating prices and introduced surcharges to protect their margins. Clearly over time, surcharge values move down as well as up. Apart from nickel, other elements typically factored into mill surcharge calculations include chrome, molybdenum, manganese, titanium, vanadium, silicon and iron (scrap). Surcharges can play a very influential role in setting the transaction price (base price + surcharge) of stainless steel, and can significantly exceed the base price.

In temper embrittlement, the steel is usually tempered at a relatively high temperature, producing lower strength and hardness and embrittlement occurs upon slow cooling after tempering and during service at temperatures within the embrittlement range.

    'term': 'Z-mill',
    'definition':
        'The full name for Z-mill is Sendzimir mill. A Z-mill operates with a very small diameter work roll, normally about two inches, backed up by a number of rolls in a pyramid-shaped stack. This roll setup allows you to exert extremely high forces through the work roll and yet keep the work roll from extreme flexing. The take-up roll on the Z-mill also exerts a tension on the coil as it comes through the mill. The combination of high pressure and tension makes the mill capable of rolling material thin and flat.'

    'term': 'ZN/P Curve',
    'definition':
        'A graphic representation of the effects of speed (N), load (P) and viscosity on the coefficient of friction (m) as a shaft rotates in a plain bearing. The dimensionless equation states that the coefficient of friction (m) is a function (f) of the ratio (viscosity x speed)/load, or m = (f)ZN/P.'

    'term': 'Zone Melting',
    'definition':
        'Highly localized melting, usually by induction heating, of a small volume of an otherwise solid metal piece, usually a metal rod by moving the induction coil along the rod, the melted zone can be transferred from one end to the other. In a binary mixture where there is a large difference in composition on the liquidus and solidus lines, high purity can be attained by concentrating one of the constituents in the liquid as it moves along the rod.'
