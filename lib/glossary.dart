Conventional FeNi typically contains around 40% Ni. The higher-grade nickel pig iron mostly comes from EAF producers. Production economics are highly dependent on world primary nickel prices, as well as on coke and electricity costs.

    'term': 'Normalizing',
    'definition':
        'Heating to a temperature about 100° F above the critical range, as indicated by the iron carbon diagram, and cooling in still air. Normalizing is used to restore the steel to its normal condition after hot working, cold working, non-uniform cooling, or overheating, or to eliminate the effects of previous heat treatment. Other common objects of normalizing include the development of uniformity in grain, structure and physical properties, a slight hardening of medium carbon steels to improve machinability and the removal of stresses, strains, or course grain prior to hardening. The usual normalizing temperatures range from about 1500° to 1800° F, depending on the steel involved.'

    'term': 'Notch Acuity',
    'definition':
        'Relates to the severity of the stress concentration produced by a given notch in a particular structure. If the depth of the notch is very small compared with the width (or diameter) of the narrowest cross section, acuity may be expressed as the ratio of the notch depth to the notch root radius. Otherwise, acuity is defined as the ratio of one-half the width (or diameter) of the narrowest cross section to the notch root radius.'
